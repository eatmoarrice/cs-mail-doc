### Server side

When developing a full-stack web, it is common to have the web's backend develop prior to front-end. One of the main reason is that it would be easier to have database ready when implementing the front-end logic of the web.

- [Design the endpoints](/doc/server/03_design_endpoints.md)
- [Design database schema](/doc/server/04_design_database.md)
- [Adding Mongoose middlewares](/doc/server/05_mongoose_middleware.md)
